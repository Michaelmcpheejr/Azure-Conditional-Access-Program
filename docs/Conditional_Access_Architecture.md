# Conditional Access Architecture

## Grouping Strategy
Hybrid grouping: identity class plus tier where needed.

## Granularity
Moderate granularity with layered enforcement.

## Layering Model
Primary enforcement policies plus secondary exception policies.

## Break-Glass Handling
Break-glass accounts are excluded from Conditional Access globally and governed via compensating controls.

## Naming Standard
Identity-based naming is used for readability and operations.
Example format: CA-Admins-Tier0-MFA
