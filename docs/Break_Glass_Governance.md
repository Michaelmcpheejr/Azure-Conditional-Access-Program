# Break-Glass Governance

## Design Choice
Break-glass accounts are excluded from Conditional Access to preserve access during outages.

## Safeguards
- Strong password stored securely
- Monitoring and alerting on any sign-in
- Approval process for use (except true emergencies)
- Periodic testing to verify access works

## Usage Rules
- Not for daily administration
- Use only during outages or emergency response
- Every use requires documentation and review

## Post-Use Actions
- Incident record created
- Access reviewed
- Password rotated
- Validate no configuration drift occurred
